      <p class="post">After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat, I believe the DBC experience will be an incredible one.  A lot of hard work and overwhelming at times...but well worth it.  I expect there to be a lot of late nights, but will try to remember if I put the cereal bowl back in the fridge then it's probably time to call it a night.</p>

      <p class="post">I think I will do well in DBC's environment.  I'm hungry to learn from everyone - teachers and students.  I'll need to remember that it's okay to be vulnerable and show my ignorance.  This is all part of the learning process and the more you put into it the more you'll get out of it.  I like that DBC has the kind of culture where everyone is working together, in the kitchen, figuring things out.</p>

      <p class="post">My expectations of DBC did not change.  Watching this video really just reinforced what I was expecting already.  I read several blogs from DBC alumni before I applied and they all mentioned it was challenging and frustrating, but most importantly - rewarding.</p>

      <p class="post">Without a doubt, I'm nervous.  In my current career, I deal with risk management so leaving my family and going without a job for 9 weeks is very unsettling.  I do worry about not being as good as everyone else ("imposter syndrome"), but if that's the case then I will use that to my advantage to have so many people to learn from.  Also, I have an introvert personality, so I'm worried about pair programming.  I think it's mostly because I've never done it before and am unfamiliar with it so I'm not really sure what to expect, but am ready to challenge myself.

      <p class="post">I'm excited to keep working through the Phase 0 prep work and learn as much as I can before leaving for Chicago.</p>
