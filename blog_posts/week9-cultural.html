        For our final blog post during Phase 0, we were asked to research how to ask/write good questions in order to get the help being sought after.  Being able to express your question clearly is an important skill to have as a developer.
      </p>
      <p class="post">
        I think the very first step, before actually even asking your question, is obviously doing some research on your own to solve the problem.  Most likely, someone else has experienced the same issue before and the answer is already out there - you just have to find it.  Google is an incredible tool for doing just this.  When searching Google, make sure to be specific with your search terms.

      <p class="post">
        If after doing research you're still stuck, then here are some tips for asking good questions in a forum like Stack Overflow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure the title of your question describes the specific problem you're trying to solve.  This will most likely be the first thing someone reads so make it meaningful.</li>
        <li>Provide some context such as language version, platform version, operating system, etc.</li>
        <li>Introduce the problem by explaining how you encountered it and list out what you've tried to do so far in attempt to solve it.</li>
        <li>Make it obvious what you are trying to get out of your question.</li>
        <li>Include any relevant code (enough code so that others will be able to reproduce the problem), as well as any results or errors you're getting.  Also, explain the outcome you were expecting to get.</li>
        <li>Before posting your question, proof-read it to make sure it is understandable and fix any spelling or grammar mistakes.</li>
      </ul>
