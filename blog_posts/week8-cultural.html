        <h2>Dealing with Conflict</h2>

        One of the last times I had conflict with someone else was while at work.  One of my direct reports came to me one day and expressed that she was having trouble with getting all of her tasks done.  After speaking with this individual, it was clear that the root of the problem was that she was taking on too many special projects at one time.  This was especially true given that she was still fairly new to her role and was still trying to learn the responsibilities of her position.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        We talked about ways she could manage her time better and that when other areas of the business asked her to work on special projects that she would really need to evaluate if she could actually commit the time it would take before volunteering to help.  She realized that she had a problem of saying "no" to people because she really enjoys helping others.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        We also talked about the special projects she was helping with and she identified one specifically that she felt like she didn't need to be involved in because it would be easy for someone else to transition over to the project and cover her part.  This project was also one of the ones taking up large amount of her time.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        After speaking with her, she said she felt better about the situation and she was planning to notify the manager over the project that she was going to be stepping away from.  She seemed a little hesitant about notifying the other manager, but when I asked her if she was comfortable with doing that she said yes so I didn't think much of it.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        After our initial talk, I later found out that she was still working on the special project and she was continuing to fall behind on her primary responsibilities.  It was really starting to affect her performance.  I found this information out from another party and I felt like she was intentionally trying to hide it from me (even thought I had no idea if this was her actual intent or not).  My initial gut reaction was to confront her immediately.  However, I realized I was too upset to approach her at that moment.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        I decided to wait a few hours to calm down and ended up speaking with her later that afternoon.  She admitted that she did not follow through on the plan we had discussed and she was falling behind.  She expressed that she was afraid of disappointing the other manager that she had made a committment to.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        We visited again about other ways she could manager her time more effectively and still work on this special project since she did make the committment.  In the end, we were able to come up with the right solution and she helped with the project and caught up on her work.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        If I could go back and do anything differently, it would be that I should have picked up on the fact that she seemed hesitant about speaking with the other manager.  I should have went with her or just done that piece for her.  I could have spoken up on her behalf, especially since I worked closely with the other manager, to where they would have been understanding of the siutation.  If I would have done that, I think it would have taken some stress off of her and would have made things go better.  I also wish she would have just been straightforward with me and told me that she didn't feel comfortable speaking with the other manager.  I think that this miscommunication made the situation worse.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        I was really proud of myself for taking a few hours to calm down before approaching her.  I think it would have caused more stress and tension (for both of us) if I had gone to her right away while I was still upset.  I also shouldn't have been so upset inthe first place because after speaking with her again I knew she wasn't intentionally trying to hide anything, she was just stressed about how to handle everything.
