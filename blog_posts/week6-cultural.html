        <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>

        Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative sterotypes about their social identity (i.e., the part of personal identity, our sense of who we are, that comes from group memberships and the social categories to which we belong: our age, sex, race religion, profession, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, region, social class, etc.).  The term stereotype threat was first used in 1995 by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson who showed in several experiments that Black college freshmen and sophmores performed worse on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized.  However, when race was not emphasized, Black students performed better or equivalently with White students.  The results showed that performance in academic contexts can be harmed by the awareness that one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes.

        As a middle class white male, I haven't experienced any notable instances of stereotype threat - at least none that I can recall at the time of this writing.  Now having lived in Arkansas my whole life, I've definitely heard my fair share of jokes about people from the South and that we're all supposedly rednecks or hillbillies.  Although, I've never been offended by any of these jokes and never felt like I was in a situation where I've underperformed because of these stereotypes.

        I've also been fortunate enough to work at a company for the last 10 years that believes strongly in diversity and inclusion, not only with their employees, but also with their suppliers and communities.  It's been great getting to work for such a company with this type of culture and beliefs and I've learned a lot as a result.

        One thing going into DBC and switching to a career in the tech industry that does have me a little concerned is my age.  I'm 30 years old (old, I know, right?).  I'm worried that my age could be a hindrance in getting a junior developer position after I graduate from DBC.  I realize these positions are usually filled by younger candidates.  Ultimately, I know that having success in landing a job after DBC will rely on much more than my age and I won't let it limit me.

        I'm grateful that DBC puts a lot of focus on empathy and being acceptive of people from all sorts of backgrounds.  Having that type of environment established will make a difference and sets a great foundation for everyone.  To help combat stereotype threat, I feel like I can make a difference by calling out negative behavior and educating others about this topic.  Also, following the golden rule by treating everyone, regardless of their social group, with respect and the way that I would want to be treated goes a long way.
