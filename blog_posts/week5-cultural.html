        All of my pairing sessions so far have been really rewarding.  I've enjoyed being able to collaborate with others to work through challenges.  Every person I've paired with has brought different experiences and skill sets and coding styles that I'm able to learn from.  I've also enjoyed sharing information with the other person and teaching them something new.

        With some of these more difficult challenges, I'm grateful that I had another set of eyes looking at the code.  Every time I've paired, it seems like we both spot things that the other person didn't catch right away.  It's also helped when one person gets stuck, usually the other person is able to keep us moving and solve the challenge.

        Also, pairing during Phase 0 has been great because we're able to get to know our fellow boots before attending DBC.

        Luckily, I have been able to pair with some really smart and kind people thus far.  I haven't ran into any major issues working with others on a challenge.  Although, I have been frustrated with some of the technology we use to collaborate.  For instance, Stypi is not always reliable and I've had trouble getting it to cooperate during multiple sessions.  As a result, I typically suggest to my pair that we don't use Stypi and just share our screens over the Google hangout.  This tends to work better.  Also, I've had a couple of pairing sessions where the other person's Internet connection was weak causing the video/audio to lag quite a bit.  Obviously, this can be annoying and makes communicating during the challenge difficult, but I understand that this is out of the other person's control.

        It has been great reading through the feedback others have left for me.  Based on my feedback so far, I need to continue to focus on communicating.  When I'm trying something out in IRB or looking at the Ruby docs, I need to share that with my pair and keep them in the loop.
      </p>
      <p class="post">
        Hopefully, the feedback I have been writing for others has been beneficial to them.  I try to write feedback immediately following a session so that I remember the specific details of our discussion and walkthrough of the challenge.  This helps me with being able to give specific and actionable feedback.
      </p>
      <p class="post">
        When writing feedback, I have found it difficult with some pairs to pin point something actionable that they could improve on especially when that person is more experienced than me.  When I'm not able to identify anything they could improve on, then I'll at least tell them exactly what they did that helped me the most during our session so that they realize it was beneficial.  I think this type of feedback can still be considered actionable because that other person may not have even realized they did something that helped me.  They may have done something that just came so natural to them, but wouldn't come so easy for others.  By leaving this feedback, they'll know exactly what worked well.
      </p>
      <p class="post">
        Overall, I definitely think pair programming has been beneficial to my learning throughout Phase 0 and will continue to be at DBC.  Hopefully, where I end up after DBC, I'll be able to continue with pair programming.
