        <h2>Exploring My Values</h2>

        When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Challenge</li>
        <li>Growth</li>
        <li>Independence</li>
        <li>Integrity</li>
        <li>Meaningful Work</li>
        <li>Stability</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="post">
        One of the most important values to me is growth.  I don't feel satisfied unless I'm constantly learning new things and pushing my personal development.  Otherwise, I feel a little like being in the movie Groundhog's Day where I'm living each day over and over again.  A lot of the values I picked above go hand in hand like challenge and growth and independence and stability.  But these can also compete against each other.  For instance, attending DBC will be an incredible challenge, but it also means that I lose stability in my life because I quit my job and am moving away from my family for 9 weeks.  These competing values can be a challenge all on their own.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        Based on the following scale, do I agree if I try to live up to these values?</br>
        Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Challenge - 4</li>
        <li>Growth - 4</li>
        <li>Independence - 5</li>
        <li>Integrity - 5</li>
        <li>Meaningful Work - 3</li>
        <li>Stability - 3</li>
      </ul>

        Do I think these values can help me mediate stereotype threat if I recognize I feel it?  Reflecting on these values, I think they will help motivate me and push onwards past any discouragement.
      </p>

      <p class="post">
        Are there any other exercises I can use to help me when I'm feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?  While I've never done it before, I'm hoping yoga will help me get some relief and help me recharge.  I also think getting enough sleep will be important.  We'll obviously be working long hours and absorbing large amounts of new material.  Getting sleep and rest will be extremely important so I'll do my best to make sure I make time for it.
