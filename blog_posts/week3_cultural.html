        <h2>My Thinking Style</h2>

      <p class="post">My primary thinking style is Concrete Sequential (CS), but I also have tendencies for Concrete Random (CR).  After doing some research, I found that CS learners have the following characteristics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Like applying logic when problem solving</li>
        <li>Oraganize and process information in a linear, step-by-step manner</li>
        <li>Learn best when in a structured environment</li>
        <li>Are inquisitive</li>
        <li>Prefers applying ideas in pragmatic ways</li>
        <li>Attentive to detail</li>
        <li>Task oriented</li>
        <li>Struggle with working in groups</li>
        <li>Have difficulty following incomplete or unclear directions</li>
        <li>Can be challenged by open-ended assignments</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="post">
        I feel like these describe me well, for the most part, and how I like learning.  The fact that I'm organized will be to my advantage throughout DBC.  So far during Phase 0, I've been breaking down each week's assignments into smaller steps to help me stay on top of it all.  I've also been taking detailed notes during the reading assignments that I can refer back to.  This really helps me solidify the learning concepts as well.  While I'm actually at DBC, I think I'll do well because I like structure and learning hands-on.  And when I'm uncertain about something, I ask clarifying questions to ensure I have a good understanding.

        I think the biggest challenge ahead of me will be working in groups.  While I do like working with other people, I find that group projects can be distracting.  I also find it difficult to express my opinions or ideas when working in groups.  Although, the pairing sessions during Phase 0 have really been beneficial to me and they are getting me out of my comfort zone and I'm learning to be more expressive.  I've enjoyed seeing how others go about solving the challenges.  I realize the ability to work collaboratively on projects will be a key skill to enhance and it will be a primary focus for me personally.
