        <h2>Net Neutrality</h2>

        So, just what is Net Neutrality?  Net Neutrality is all about keeping the Internet open for everyone.  It means that Internet service providers (ISPs), like Comcast and Time Warner Cable, must treat all data passed over its network equally, regardless of the content or who sent it or who is receiving it.  ISPs should not be allowed to give preference to one site over another.  This principle enables and protects our right to communicate freely online.  It makes for a fair and level playing field for everyone, including startups, nonprofits and community projects like Wikipedia.

        Earlier this year, there was a court decision that threw out the FCC's Open Internet Order of 2010 that kept ISPs from blocking or discriminating against any Internet traffic.  The court ruled that the FCC lacked the authority to implement and enforce these rules because ISPs are classified as providers of information services rather than telecommunications services.  As a result, ISPs are now able to implement a two-tiered system (i.e., fast and slow lanes) and charge companies additional fees to have their content delivered uninterrupted and ahead of other companies that don't pay (or cannot afford to pay) these fees.  The ISPs are promising not to slow down websites and they would like you to think of the system more of as a fast and hyper-speed lane instead of a fast and slow lane (a.k.a. dirt road).  In fact, this has already happened - take a look at the deal Comcast struck with Netflix.

        Additionally, in May 2014, the FCC proposed rules that would open enable ISPs to charge extra fees for paid prioritization and preferential treatment.  Essentially, ISPs could selectively censor the Internet and pick and choose which content you are able to view.  However, the FCC is accepting comments from the public for 120 days.

        So, while we may have lost the battle, we have not lost the war for Net Neutrality.  Action can still be taken to fix this problem.  I encourage you to visit the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/comments">FCC's website</a> and let them know that the proposed rules would not maintain an open Internet.  Tell the FCC that they need to reclassify broadband Internet as a telecommunications service and ISPs as common carriers.  Doing so would provide the FCC the proper authority it needs to adopt and enforce Net Neutrality rules.
