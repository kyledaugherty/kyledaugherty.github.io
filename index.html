      <p class="post"><a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> is hands down the one site I use most often.  It is simple and clean.  It is that simplicity which allows users to focus on their searching and not be distracted by headlines, trends, etc. (like with Yahoo!)  The home page primarily consists of a search field and button.  On other pages (e.g., search results), Google does show ads, but it is not overly cluttered.  This makes it very easy to find what you are looking for.</p>

      <p class="post">Google wouldn't be much of a search engine if it was not functional and relevant.  Clearly, they have mastered this craft.  The predictive searching is like they are pulling ninja mind tricks...<a href="blog_posts/week1_technical.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

      <p class="post">After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat, I believe the DBC experience will be an incredible one.  A lot of hard work and overwhelming at times...but well worth it.  I expect there to be a lot of late nights, but will try to remember if I put the cereal bowl back in the fridge then it's probably time to call it a night.</p>

      <p class="post">I think I will do well in DBC's environment.  I'm hungry to learn from everyone - teachers and students.  I'll need to remember that it's okay to be vulnerable and show my ignorance.  This is all part of the learning process and the more you put into it the...<a href="blog_posts/week1_cultural.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

      <p class="post">Google's home page is all about simplicity and no distractions.  They want the user to be able to immediately focus their attention on searching.  Their clean design does just that.  After you search they can then provide you with relevant content and ads.  <a href="blog_posts/wireframe_sites.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

      <p class="post">Any HTML element can be thought of as a box and in CSS this is referred to as the box model.  There are 4 different parts that make up the box model which consists of margin, borders, padding and the actual content inside the HTML element.  Here is an illustration of the box model: <a href="blog_posts/week2-technical.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

      <p class="post">JavaScript (JS) was created in the mid-90s (back in the days of Netscape!).  Before that, web pages were static and there was no way for you to interact with the page.  JS provides the ability to deliver rich, dynamic web content and has, according to RedMonk, become the most popular programming language.</p>

      <p class="post">My primary thinking style is Concrete Sequential (CS), but I also have tendencies for Concrete Random (CR).  After doing some research, I found that CS learners have the following characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Like applying logic when problem solving</li>
        <li>Oraganize and process information in a linear, step-by-step manner</li>
        <li>Learn best when in a structured environment</li>
        <li>Are inquisitive</li>
        <li>Prefers applying ideas in pragmatic ways</li>
        <li>Attentive to detail</li>
        <li>Task oriented</li>
        <li>Struggle with working in groups</li>
        <li>Have difficulty following incomplete or unclear directions</li>
        <li>Can be challenged by open-ended assignments</li>

      <p class="post">Ruby classes, like Array and Hash, include what is known as the Enumberable module.  The Enumera-what?  Basically, the Enumerable module is a package of several methods that can be mixed in with other classes.  Ruby programmers are lazy and strongly believe in the DRY principle which means don't repeat yourself (or your code).  So, instead of having to write the methods many different times, they can be written just once and ... <a href="blog_posts/week4-technical.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

      <p class="post">So, just what is Net Neutrality?  Net Neutrality is all about keeping the Internet open for everyone.  It means that Internet service providers (ISPs), like Comcast and Time Warner Cable, must treat all data passed over its network equally, regardless of the content or who sent it or who is receiving it.  ISPs should not be allowed to give preference to one site over another.  This principle enables and protects our right to communicate freely online.  It makes for a fair and level playing field for everyone, including startups ... <a href="blog_posts/week4-cultural.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

      <p class="post">Classes are the blue prints used to create objects in Ruby.  They serve as a way to organize object behavior (methods) and attributes (data).

      <p class="post">Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative sterotypes about their social identity (i.e., the part of personal identity, our sense of who we are, that comes from group memberships and the social categories to which we belong: our age, sex, race religion, profession, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, region, social class, etc.).

      <p class="post">SQL injection is a hacking technique that attempts to pass malicious SQL commands through a web application for execution by the backend database.  If the web application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, then the hacker may be able to view information from the database or even delete or alter information.  This type of attack is so common because of how simple it is to exploit and the fact that there are many web applications out there that remain vulnerable (despite that it is... <a href="blog_posts/week7-technical.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

      <p class="post">A regular expression is a search pattern that can be matched against some text.  For example, you could use a regular expression (a.k.a. regex or regexp) to see if a paragraph contained the word "apple."  Or you could use a regular expression for something a bit more complex like checking to see if text contained an email address or a phone number.  Part of what makes regular expressions so powerful is that you... <a href="blog_posts/week8-technical.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>
