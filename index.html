      <p class="post"><a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> is hands down the one site I use most often.  It is simple and clean.  It is that simplicity which allows users to focus on their searching and not be distracted by headlines, trends, etc. (like with Yahoo!)  The home page primarily consists of a search field and button.  On other pages (e.g., search results), Google does show ads, but it is not overly cluttered.  This makes it very easy to find what you are looking for.</p>

      <p class="post">Google wouldn't be much of a search engine if it was not functional and relevant.  Clearly, they have mastered this craft.  The predictive searching is like they are pulling ninja mind tricks...<a href="unit1_projects/blog_posts/week1_technical.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

      <p class="post">After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat, I believe the DBC experience will be an incredible one.  A lot of hard work and overwhelming at times...but well worth it.  I expect there to be a lot of late nights, but will try to remember if I put the cereal bowl back in the fridge then it's probably time to call it a night.</p>

      <p class="post">I think I will do well in DBC's environment.  I'm hungry to learn from everyone - teachers and students.  I'll need to remember that it's okay to be vulnerable and show my ignorance.  This is all part of the learning process and the more you put into it the...<a href="unit1_projects/blog_posts/week1_cultural.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

      <p class="post">Google's home page is all about simplicity and no distractions.  They want the user to be able to immediately focus their attention on searching.  Their clean design does just that.  After you search they can then provide you with relevant content and ads.  <a href="unit1_projects/blog_posts/wireframe_sites.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

        <h2>Difference Between Margin, Border and Padding</h2>

      <p class="post">Any HTML element can be thought of as a box and in CSS this is referred to as the box model.  There are 4 different parts that make up the box model which consists of margin, borders, padding and the actual content inside the HTML element.  Here is an illustration of the box model: <a href="unit1_projects/blog_posts/week2-technical.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>

        <h2>Why is Javascript So Popular?</h2>

      <p class="post">JavaScript (JS) was created in the mid-90s (back in the days of Netscape!).  Before that, web pages were static and there was no way for you to interact with the page.  JS provides the ability to deliver rich, dynamic web content and has, according to RedMonk, become the most popular programming language.</p>

      <p class="post">My primary thinking style is Concrete Sequential (CS), but I also have tendencies for Concrete Random (CR).  After doing some research, I found that CS learners have the following characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Like applying logic when problem solving</li>
        <li>Oraganize and process information in a linear, step-by-step manner</li>
        <li>Learn best when in a structured environment</li>
        <li>Are inquisitive</li>
        <li>Prefers applying ideas in pragmatic ways</li>
        <li>Attentive to detail</li>
        <li>Task oriented</li>
        <li>Struggle with working in groups</li>
        <li>Have difficulty following incomplete or unclear directions</li>
        <li>Can be challenged by open-ended assignments</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="post">I feel like these describe me well, for the most part, and how I like learning.  The fact that I'm organized will be to my advantage throughout DBC.<a href="unit1_projects/blog_posts/week3_cultural.html"> Continue Reading</a></p>
