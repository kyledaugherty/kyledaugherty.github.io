        <h2>Three of My Favorite Sites</h2>
        <p class="post-date"><em>Posted on 7 Jun 2014 by <a href="mailto:kyle.daugherty@gmail.com">Kyle Daugherty</a></em></p>
        <h3>Google</h3>
      </header>
      <p class="post"><a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> is hands down the one site I use most often.  It is simple and clean.  It is that simplicity which allows users to focus on their searching and not be distracted by headlines, trends, etc. (like with Yahoo!)  The home page primarily consists of a search field and button.  On other pages (e.g., search results), Google does show ads, but it is not overly cluttered.  This makes it very easy to find what you are looking for.</p>

      <p class="post">Google wouldn't be much of a search engine if it was not functional and relevant.  Clearly, they have mastered this craft.  The predictive searching is like they are pulling ninja mind tricks and reading your thoughts.  They do an incredible job of understanding the context of your searches to provide the most relevant information to you.</a></p>

      <p class="post">One of my only critiques I've noticed would be when you search for restaurants.  On the results page, it shows a scrolling list of the restaurants near you, but the dark background of this section does not fit with the overall theme in my opinion.  I think they should make the area much lighter.</p>

        <h3>Chewy</h3>
      </header>
      <p class="post">I'm a big pet lover and am frequently spoiling my dog with treats.  I always order from <a href="http://www.chewy.com" target="_blank">Chewy.com</a>.  Besides that they have great service and competitive prices, I really like the look of their site.</p>

      <p class="post">Overall, their site is well designed.  All of the colors they've chosen for their theme go well together.  The layout of their site makes it easy to navigate and browse through their products.</p>

      <p class="post">My biggest complaint about their site <em>was</em> that it was not responsive and they did not have a mobile version.  They recently fixed that so I don't really have any negatives here.</p>

        <h3>Amazon</h3>
      </header>
      <p class="post">I find myself using <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a> a lot - even though I'm not the biggest fan of their site design.  I think their home page is cluttered and I always feel like they are throwing products in my face.  On their product pages, they have so much information...sometimes too much.  But I will admit, other times all that information is just what I'm looking for in order to make a buying decision.</p>
