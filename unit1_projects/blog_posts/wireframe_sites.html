        <h3>Google</h3>
      </header>
      <p class="post">Google's home page is all about simplicity and no distractions.  They want the user to be able to immediately focus their attention on searching.  Their clean design does just that.  After you search they can then provide you with relevant content and ads.</p>

        <h3>Chewy</h3>
      </header>
      <p class="post">Chewy's home page is about promoting why customers should shop with them.  I think their challenge is that they are not a big brand name company and they need to highlight their key benefits.  I think they do that well.</p>

        <h3>Amazon</h3>
      </header>
      <p class="post">I think Amazon's home page is trying to inform consumers about special promotions and products based on your browsing history to make it more personal.  Their promotions are also relevant based on the day, season, current events, etc.  I think their challenge is that they offer so many products, how do they showcase them and make it easy for their users to find what they are looking for without making it overwhelming.</p>
