        <h2>Why is JavaScript Popular in Web Development?</h2>

      <p class="post">JavaScript (JS) was created in the mid-90s (back in the days of Netscape!).  Before that, web pages were static and there was no way for you to interact with the page.  JS provides the ability to deliver rich, dynamic web content and has, according to RedMonk, become the most popular programming language.</p>

      <p class="post">Let's take a look at some of the pros and cons:</p>

      <h3>Advantages</h3>
      <p class="post">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Easy to Learn:</b> JS has been around for several years so there are numerous resources available online making it easy to learn and implement.</li>
          <li><b>Speed:</b> Being client-side, JS is very fast because the script can run immediately instead of having to contact and wait for the server.  This also reduces the demand on the website server.</li>
          <li><b>Ready to Go:</b> All major browsers have JS interpreters built in and there are no plug-ins to install.</li>
          <li><b>Easy to Debug:</b> Using tools like Chrome Dev Tools and FireBug make it easy for developers to debug their code.</li>
          <li><b>Versatility</b> JS has primarily been used for front-end development; however, that has changed thanks to server-side solutions like Node.js.  Running a Node.js server means startups with small development teams can reallocate front-end developers when needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
      <p class="post">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Security Issues:</b> Malicious code can be executed on the users' computer.</li>
          <li><b>Inconsistent Rendering:</b> Browsers interpret JS differently resulting in inconsistency and unpredictability.  Also, there's a small percentage of users who have JS disabled in their browers.</li>
        </ul>
