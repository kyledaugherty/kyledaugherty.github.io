      <h2>Steps for teaching your dog to sit</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Work with your dog in an environment that's comfortable for him and somewhere without distractions.</li>
        <li>Stand in front of your dog so that you are facing each other.  He should be focused on you.</li>
        <li>To help get his attention, show him that you have a small treat.  Hold it in your hand, close to his nose.</li>
        <li>Continuing to hold the treat close to his head (so he doesn't jump), slowly move the treat from the dog's nose to behind his head.  He will be laser focused on the treat and will naturally sit down to follow it.</li>
        <li>As soon as his rear end touches the floor or ground, say "sit" and reward him with the treat in your hand.  Give him plenty of praise for a job well done.</li>
        <li>Repeat these steps for only 10-15 minutes.  You don't want to wear him out and lose his attention.  Dogs are like small children in that they have a short attention span and get bored easily.  Continue with training over the next few days until he is able to sit on command without needing a treat.</li>
      </ol>
